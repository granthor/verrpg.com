# Elemental Space

**Governed by Psicorna, Dragon of Space, her words declare:** Space can be
understood as an infinite field of points which can be stretched and compressed.
You can manipulate individual points by exchanging them, reorienting them, or
linking them together. Exchanged points will also exchange anything occupying
where the points were. Reorienting points can be used to rotated objects or
regions of space. Linked points act as the same point and anything passing
through one will come out the other one, by default the direction is maintained
but a practiced space mage can change this orientation by first linking them and
then reorienting one of the points.

## Details

You cannot link or influence points in another plane or universe, but you can
access a special extra dimensional plane called The Scraps. This plane was
created by Psicorna and space mages can reserve regions within it to create
extra-dimensional pockets that linger and can be accessed repeatedly by the
space mage. To do this you must briefly contact Psicorna and she will give you a
region of space relevant to your power.
