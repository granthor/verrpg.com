## Precepts

### Precept, Edicts
Treat all living things the same, be they plant, beast, or golem. Protect what is natural and pure from forces that would exploit or destroy it and enforce the laws of nature. All things eat. All things die. To the hunter goes the catch, and those who survive, survive.

### Precept, Idol
These powers require an Idol in the image of my symbol, a willow tree with fluttering branches. While holding my Idol you will become more perceptive of the natural things around you.

## Genres

### Genre, Floral
Requires rating of Beginner (1). Allows communication with living plants, though they are generally poor sources of information they are eager conversationalists and often happy to aid those who speak to them and pay respect. Plants you are communicating with also become more flexible and mobile, and able to move and act on their own accord.

**From Memories** Requires Rating of Advanced (3). You may apply Floral to dead plants. The difficulty of this is dependent on how far removed they are from their original form. A deadfall is easier to communicate with than a floorboard, and a floorboard is easier than a cotton shirt.

### Genre, Faunal
Requires rating of Intermediate (2). Allows communication with living beasts. Animals can be great sources of information and aid, but are more reserved than plants. If you fail to convince an animal to aid, you will likely have to bargain with them to engage their services.

## Addendums

### Addendum, Virulent Growth
Requires rating of Master (4). By pressing your hand against living plant or beast you can temporarily empower them to significant levels. Animals can be granted bursts of speed, strength, or be made to double in size and plants or parts thereof can be guided to grow into supernatural proportions at violent speeds and your direction.

Effected beasts will remain empowered until the end of the encounter. Plants which have been grown will remain, though if not structurally sound segments of them may collapse or break after some time.
