## Governed By:

## Precepts

### Precept, Foci:
Casting elemental magic requires a magical foci: Orb, Wand, Staff or Literature.

### Precept, Inner Light:
When you cast effects which create light you begin to glow, letting off soft wisps of light and when you create darkness your shadow grows large and spreads about you. 

## Genres

### Genre, Luminosity:
Requires Rating of Beginner (1). Form a source of either light or darkness. Like normal light sources, these emit or suppress light in all directions over a small radius. The maximum number of sources created and intensity of the light or darkness will depend on the effect's rating. Light sources created this way last until the end of the encounter. 

By default targets standing in regions of bright light are easier to see and target (Circumstance +2), while those standing in regions of dim light are more difficult to see and target (Circumstance -2). 

**Pop Light** Requires Rating of Beginner (1). Requires a movement action only and does not require a roll. Pop a source of light or darkness within Close (1-5m) range creating an intense burst of light or darkness. Popped light can blind or inflict minor damage to adjacent creatures, and popped darkness creates a sphere of total blackness covering it and all adjacent spaces which cannot be seen into or out of and lasts until the start of your next turn.

A popped light counts as an attack against a target's Escape with rating equal to your Elemental Light skill. Blinded targets will take Circumstance -4 on all actions during their next turn and light sensitive targets may suffer damage.

### Genre, Illusion:
Requires Rating of Intermediate (2): Twist light into an illusion of your own imagination and tie it to an animate or inanimate object. The easiest illusions are inanimate ones, or animated ones which move in repeated cycles, but more advanced illusions can act and appear to interact with the world as their real counterpart would. All illusions are physically tied to their object and will move with it, or dissipate if the object is destroyed. 

Illusions last a single round by default, but can be maintained for the cost of your Free Action as long as they remain within your range.

Illusions are an attack against a target's Wit. Targets may be granted a Wit bonus or penalty based on how believable the illusion is within it's current surroundings. 

## Addendums

### Addendum, Printasmic Apotheosis:
Requires Rating of Master (4).
