## Genres

### Genre, Lumen Prism:
Requires Rating of Beginner (1). Form a small, prism-like barrier which either amplifies or dims any light passing through it. This does not effect the light source itself, but does allow you to control it's luminosity. Skilled users can cause the prism to reflect or redirect light, or cause the surface of the prism to vary and specify different levels of amplification or dimming over different segments.

Though multiple prisms can be created at once with skilled casting, all prism segments must be kept small and encase a source of light. Skilled casting can link a prism segment to a physical light source, causing the prism to follow the light if it is moved.

This barrier is permiable and can be passed through with ease. When placed around a source of normal light it can easily be made to either amplify light that passes through it into Bright Light or lessen it into Dim Light.



**Eat Light** Requires Rating of Beginner (1). Requires a movement action only and does not require a roll. Pop a source of light or darkness within Close (1-5m) range creating an intense burst of light or darkness. Popped light can blind or inflict minor damage to adjacent creatures, and popped darkness creates a sphere of total blackness covering it and all adjacent spaces which cannot be seen into or out of and lasts until the start of your next turn.

A popped light counts as an attack against a target's Escape with rating equal to your Elemental Light skill. Blinded targets will take Circumstance -4 on all actions during their next turn and light sensitive targets may suffer damage.

### Genre, Illusion:
Requires Rating of Intermediate (2): Twist light into an illusion of your own imagination and tie it to an animate or inanimate object. The easiest illusions are inanimate ones, or animated ones which move in repeated cycles, but more advanced illusions can act and appear to interact with the world as their real counterpart would. All illusions are physically tied to their object and will move with it, or dissipate if the object is destroyed. 

Illusions last a single round by default, but can be maintained for the cost of your Free Action as long as they remain within your range.

Illusions are an attack against a target's Wit. Targets may be granted a Wit bonus or penalty based on how believable the illusion is within it's current surroundings. 

## Addendums

### Addendum, Printasmic Apotheosis:
Requires Rating of Master (4).
