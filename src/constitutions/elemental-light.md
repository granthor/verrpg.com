## Genres

### Genre, Luminosity:
Requires Rating of Beginner (1): Form a source of either light or darkness. Like normal light sources, these emit or suppress light in a spherical radius. The maximum number of sources created and intensity of the light or darkness will depend on the effect's Potency and Rating. 

Light sources created this way which last until the end of the encounter and can easily create regions of either Bright Light, or Dim Light. 

Light sources created this way which last a single round can create regions of Darkness, or inflict Blinded on targets.

Modification of pre-existing light sources is easier than creation of new ones. If placed over a pre-existing light source this Genre modifies it instead of forming a new light, gain Circumstance +4.

**Eat Light**
Requires Rating of Intermediate (2): You may spend a Move Action to eat Close (5m) magical sources of light or darkness, extinguishing them. You may eat as many sources as you wish in a single action, and as long as you eat at least one, gain Circumstance +4 on the next Elemental Light effect you create. This bonus cannot stack.

### Genre, Illusion:
Requires Rating of Intermediate (2): Twist light into an illusion of your own imagination and tie it to an animate or inanimate object. The easiest illusions are inanimate ones, or animated ones which move in repeated cycles, but more advanced illusions can act and appear to interact with the world as their real counterpart would. All illusions are physically tied to their object and will move with it, or dissipate if the object is destroyed. 

Illusions last a single round by default, but can be maintained for the cost of your Free Action as long as they remain within your range.

Illusions are an attack against a target's Wit. Targets may be granted a Wit bonus or penalty based on how believable the illusion is within it's current surroundings. 

## Addendums

### Addendum, Printasmic Apotheosis:
Requires Rating of Master (4) and a period of intense research, encounter with Aroura, or similar trigger event. You can bend light into a deadly new form which shimmers in a wild mirage of colors and vaporizes everything it touches. This is most commonly projected into beams, but can be formed into walls, fired in bolts, crafted into temporary weapons, or simply allowed to explode, destroying everything nearby. 

Printasmic light pierces any target, living or not, which does not resist it and can easily burn through most solid materials.

This is a Thaumic attack which inflicts Blindness and either Violence equal to twice an effect's Potency or Shred equal to 1/4 an effect's Potency. Chaos frequently manifests as loss of control over the light's direction and area of effect.

This Genre requires intense concentration and can only be used while under the effects of **Eat Light**. Should an effect fail, the Printasmic light escapes your control, often with devastating consequences.
