## Precepts

### Precept, Edicts
Protect the weak from the wicked, and the wicked from themselves. Empathy and understanding are the highest virtues. The outcome which is proper is not always the one which is just.

### Precept, Chains
I shall grant you two chains with which to fullfil these edicts. They are bound to your Idol of me and should it be taken from you or lost, they too will be lost until you regain your Idol. My symbol is that of a mountain, wrapped in shattered chains.
	
Summoning a Chain is a Free Action.

## Genres

### Genre, Chain of Chilled Iron
Requires rating of Beginner (1). Summon a chain of metal seeming to be made of glittering iron. It appears wrapped around your wrist and can be extended and retracted at will, though not at a fast pace. It can be used to strike foes, but it's primary uses are to restrain or protect. 
	
While restraining or protecting a target you must stay within range to maintain the effect, or else attempt to pull them along with you.
	
This chain can only grant Fortification against Physical defense types.
	
The Chain of Chilled Iron is restricted to a Close (1-5m) Range, regardless of the idol used, and has its own hit die.

Requires rating of Beginner (1). Summon a spirit chain that wraps around your wrist and can be controlled at will. This chain latches onto a target's spirit, either Fortifying or slowly draining them of the will to fight.
	
While restraining or protecting a target you must stay within range to maintain the effect.
	
This chain can only grant Fortification against Spiritual defense types.
	
The Chain of Willed Soul is restricted to a Close (1-5m) Range, regardless of the idol used, and has its own hit die.

\*You can choose to grapple the target as well, wrapping the chain around them.

## Addendums

### Addendum, Perfect Empathy
Requires rating of at least Intermediate (2). Once you truly understand others, and take their feelings for your own, you will be able to detach the chains I have given you, and conjure more from within. This transformation is permanent and requires some kind of catalyzing act.
