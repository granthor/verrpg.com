# Character Progression

Characters start at Level 1 with 0 Tales. Level and Tales are the two different
ways that your character grows. Level growth represents your characterâ€™s core
features, and their growth as a person. While Tales represent your stories, and
give you strange traits to make your character distinct.

## Levels

Levels range from 1 to 12, and are given out as your character does noteworthy
things. ToV is a narrative game, and your character will be given levels by the
GM, when natural story beats happen. For instance, finishing the mystery you've
been investigating, or overthrowing the evil dictator of a kingdom. Levels are
given out after the climax.

Levels themselves control nearly every part of your character. They control,
your skills max rank, your defense values, your attributes, and more. What this
means is that the difference between levels is important, and a level 3 is for
the most part strictly better than a level 1 or 2. Finally, due to the
compounding factors, levels strength seems to grow exponentially. The difference
between a level 1 character and level 2 is minor, while the difference between a
level 11 and level 12 is a large gap. Keep this in mind when thinking about the
scope, as a group of level 4 characters will be helping to save villages, while
a level 8 character will be helping to save countries, and a level 12 character
will be helping to save the plane.

Because levels determine so many things, here is a helpful table to see what
different values are at different levels. You can also find this data in the
[Leveling Up](./leveling-up.md) page, which tells you precisely what you have to
do between levels.

|                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|:----------------|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Level            | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|
|Skill Rank Cap   | 0| 1|  | 2|  | 3|  | 4|  | 5|  | 6|
|Skill Buys       | 0| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|
|Background Skills| 1|  |  | 2|  |  |  | 3|  |  |  | 4|
|Attibute Cap     | 2|  | 3|  |  | 4|  |  | 5|  |  | 6|
|Base Defense     | 0| 1|  | 2|  | 3|  | 4|  | 5|  | 6|
|Average Tales    | 0| 5|10|15|20|25|30|35|40|45|50|55|

## Tales

Tales are a resource which can be used to purchase [traits](./traits.md). They
are a currency which represents how many interesting stories you've accumulated
as an adventurer.

You'll be given tales as interesting things happen,and the number of tales you
get may be proportional to the rarity of the event, and the long lasting
character impact. Fighting an *Instres Demon* is probably worth a tale, but
getting your eye's gauged out by that demon definitely is worth 2 or 3 tales.

Unlike levels, Tales can vary more per player without breaking the balance of
the game, meaning a GM can feel comfortable in giving some players more Tales
than others, that said GM's should strive to keep players around the same number
of Tales, and to about 5 tales per level.

Finally, a note for GMs. Since Tales are a currency you can feel comfortable
using them for in game things. Perhaps there are a race of creatures which trade
in tales, hungry for stories of adventures, and willing to part with valuables
to hear them. Or maybe you want to homebrew a rule about how the players can
spend tales to improve the reputation of the adventuring guild, gaining access
to more interesting quests, and bigger rewards. Just note that if you do this
you may have to give out more tales to ensure that players can get the traits
they want.

## Starting at Higher Levels

If you and your group decide not to start at Level 1 (not an uncommon thing to
do), you can simply make level 1 characters and then go through the process of
leveling them up as many times as desired. Though there are a couple of
resources you should also gain more of

Firstly, players should have some number of tales, as a rule of thumb, give
players about 5 tales per level past level 1. This means players starting at
level 3 will have around 10 tales to grab some interesting traits with.

Secondly, if you are using the [Commerce System](./commerce.md) consider if your
characters should start at a higher wealth. If you are having trouble figuring
out where to put the players, you can generally base their commerce rank off of
their Skill Rank Cap. Since, at level 6 you have a Skill Rank Cap of 3, then
maybe the wealth should be Skilled Laborer(3). This is a much looser rule than
the already loose tales rule, and should vary greatly from player to player, and
game to game. Below is a table with rough starting values for higher levels

|      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|:-----|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Level | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|
|Tales | 0| 5|10|15|20|25|30|35|40|45|50|55|
|Wealth| 0| 1|  | 2|  | 3|  | 4|  | 5|  | 6|

Also keep in mind the amount of history, and notoriety your character has should
make sense for your Level. A Level 1 represents potential, your first few
adventures, A Level 3 or higher character though is likely somewhat established.
Think about what they did to get where they are now, who they hurt and helped
in doing so, and how they are known in the world around them.

## Summary

Levels range from 1 to 12, and you start at level 1. Levels influence almost
every part of your character. Meanwhile, tales are the adventures you've been
on, and can be used to purchase traits. If starting at higher make sure to
adjust levels as well as wealth to match.
