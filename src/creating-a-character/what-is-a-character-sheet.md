# What is a Character Sheet

A character sheet is a tool for you to remember all the information about your
character. This can be whatever works best for you; a piece of paper, a
spreadsheet, an encrypted document. We have provided a character sheet pdf file
with most everything you need if you'd like to use it, but don't feel compelled
to. Regardless of what you use, be sure to keep good track of this, especially
if youâ€™re recording it non-digitally.

## Summary

A Character sheet is where you keep track of the various statistics for your
character. You can use the provided PDF file, or create your own.
