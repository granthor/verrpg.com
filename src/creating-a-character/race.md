# Your Race

Your race is a key part of your character and lays out for you how you'll
determine your [Attributes](./attributes.md), and
[Defense Values](./defense.md), as well as give you Languages, and a powerful
Racial ability. If this is your first time reading about the game, it is
recommended you look at attributes and defenses *first* before choosing your
race, as it will help you make a more informed decision about the impacts on
your character.

## Race Rarity

The primary way of distinguishing between races is rarity. Every race is either
common, uncommon, or rare. This doesn't have much of an impact except that
uncommon and rare races are seen less often in the world, be that because they
only exist in certain geographical areas, or because their status in the world
causes them to live particular lifestyles.

In terms of gameplay common races are more inviting for new players, having less
mechanically heavy racials, more forgiving defenses, and incorporating into the
world easily. Listed below are some common races we recommend checking out on
your first time playing. If you are a returning player--or just want to be
experimental--you can look at [Uncommon Races](../races/uncommon.md) or [Rare
Races](../races/rare.md). Or you can look at the related races under any of the
listed races below. Finally you can find more common races in [Common
Races](../races/common.md)
