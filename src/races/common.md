## Goran
The survivors, the wanderers, Goran live where living is hard and life can end with the fall of a monster’s claw, or a frigid wind’s breath. They live tribally, and don’t mix much with other races. Skill in combat is essential in their barbarian society, and everything from personal disputes to politics can be solved through conflict. They usually worship Grondshok, though a few follow Wimble. Some of the more brutal tribes follow darker entities still.

## Drost
The laborer cast of dwarvish society. Drost work hard to keep a fortress running, ore flowing, and mugs of mead filled to the brim. They are also the least restricted of the Dwarf-Kin, and most likely to be seen venturing outside of a fortress without the brand of a race traitor. Any dwarf not of a specific bloodline, or resulting in the unregulated mixing of two bloodlines, is cast as a Drost. They often worship Krunder, Noel, or Lindora.

## Pirate
Not a cast of dwarvish society, but a resistance group. These dwarves left the dwarven fortresses centuries ago, and created their own governments focused on dwarven freedom. Pirates are a resolute folk who go against the tide of dwarven society. They often work with underground organizations to afford their living. If you see a dwarf without a brand, they are either quickly returning to a fortress, or are a Pirate.
