# Companion Traits

The traits in this document are focused around companions, familiars, and pets
that help your character.

**Has a Pet**, Tales: 2
This trait may only be taken at character creation or at GM discretion.

You have an ordinary pet, partially trained. They are an independent, mortal
creature. A comforting companion.

Choose a commonly domesticated or tamable animal for your pet. They count as an
NPC, and are controlled by the GM. As with any animal, you can perform a CNT
roll or relevant skill check to attempt to command or communicate with them.
Your pet is mortal, it can get sick, injured, and be killed. In the case your
pet has died you may pay 1 tale to gain a new one at GM discretion.

Pets use a simplified stat block with ATTS collapsed into three categories:
Physical (VIG/DEX), Mental (EDU/COG), and Spiritual (CNT/RES); Defensees
collapse into three similar categories: Dexterous, Cognitive, and Resolve.
Determine values with the GM, following these guidelines.
- Total ATT: -2,
- Total Defense: -2,
- Toughness: 5 - 8,
- Tenacity: 2 - 4,
- Max Wounds: 2,
- One Beginner (1) Background Skill in being whatever type of creature they are.

**Has a Familiar**, Tales: 12, Requires 'Has a Pet'
Gain a new familiar in addition to your pet. Alternatively, your old pet and
the bond between you has been enhanced and transformed them into a stronger
creature.

Choose a somewhat exotic animal, or common magical creature for your familiar.
They count as an NPC and are controlled by the GM, but you can give them basic
commands with a Free action. Your familiar is mortal, it can get sick, injured,
and be killed. In the case your familiar has died you may pay 1 Tale to gain a
new one at GM discretion.

Familiars are more powerful, and your connection is too. Gain your familiar's
natural language. For a Free action you can sense the general direction and
distance between you and your familiar. Because familiars are strong, determine
a new stat block with your GM based on these guidelines.
- Total ATT: 0,
- Total Defense: 1,
- Toughness: 8 - 12,
- Tenacity: 3 - 6,
- Max Wounds: 2,
- One Beginner (1) Background Skill in being whatever type of creature they are.
- One Intermediate (2) Skill of your choosing.

**Pet Assistant**, Tales: 3, Requires 'Has a Pet'
When within arms reach of your pet, or familiar, you may choose to have them
assist you with a skill check. The pet loses 1 Toughness as it exerts itself to
help you. You gain a Circumstance bonus equal to your pet's applicable ATT stat.

**Bonded Familiar**, Tales: 3, Requires 'Has a Pet'
The bond between you and your pet or familiar is extraordinarily strong. With a
Free action you can sense the precise direction and distance between you and
your familiar at any range. While within Close to Far range you can discern your
familiars exact location, status, and communicate telepathically. For a Movement
or Normal action you may meld your and your Familiar's Mental Surface,
experiencing each other's current thoughts, sensory input, and short term
memory.
