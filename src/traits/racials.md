# Racial Traits

**Topples Dice**, Tales: 6, Requires: Goblin Racial

Luck shifts in odd ways around you. You may now spend two Goblin Points to shift
the side of a rolled dice to any adjacent (share a side length) face, rather
than re-rolling it.

**Sturdy as Scrap**, Tales: 8, Requires: Drost Racial

Your wounds react stronger than your kin. Replace your racial ability with the
following: When wounded, gain +2 defense against all damage types of the same
category (Dexterous, Cognitive, or Resolve), until the end of the current
Encounter.

**Lightning Reflexes**, Tales: 6, Requires: Fairy Racial

Some call you jumpy. Unnervingly so. Replace your racial ability with the
following: At the start of Turn Time you may add -VIG\*2 to your Initiative
roll.

**Pained Rage**, Tales: 6, Requires: Goran Racial

The battle rage of your ancestors runs strong in you. Replace you racial ability
with the following: When you suffer a wound, do not regain Toughness. Instead
immediately take an extra turn. Gain Circumstance equal to your Tenacity*2 until
the end of your turn. If you wound a target during this extra turn, regain
toughness equal to your Tenacity. Effects that happen at the start of your turn
happen immediately. If the wound would kill you, gain this extra turn in
addition to your last action before death.

**Gossip**, Tales: 8, Requires: Vincal or CNT 3+

You know a bit of everything about everyone. You have a maximum of 3 Gossip
Points, and begin with 3 Gossip Points. While conversing with a target you may
expend 1 Gossip Point to alter their Disposition towards another target (not
yourself) by plus or minus one, for the next hour. Some targets may be willing
to give you information in exchange for Gossip Points. You regain one or more
Gossip Points anytime you learn a particularly juicy bit of information that is
not common knowledge.
