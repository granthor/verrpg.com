# Dice, and Jargon

## Dice

It is common in tabletop roleplaying games, such as Tales of Ver, to introduce
some amount of randomness through the game using dice. In Tales of Ver we use
two different types of dice to introduce randomness. The 6 sided dice, and the
20 sided dice. It is common to refrence these die as "1d6" for 1, 6 sided die,
and "1d20" for 1, 20 sided die.To expand this notation, we can say something
like "3d6" for 3, 6 sided die, or "5d20" for 5, 20 sided die.
