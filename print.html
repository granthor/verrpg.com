<p>This section is all about teaching you the basics of Tales of Ver on a
conceptual level, rather than a mechanical one. You won’t learn how to attack a
goblin, or become a raging mechanical barbarian, but you will learn what the
game is about, what you’ll need to play, and a lot of the words we use to talk
about Tales of Ver in later chapters.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-tales-of-ver"><a class="header" href="#what-is-tales-of-ver">What is Tales of Ver?</a></h1>
<p>Tales of Ver is a roleplaying game like Pathfinder, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Mutants
&amp; Masterminds, and more. The game gives you a world and character that you can
explore with your friends. Tales of Ver or ToV for short is all about
storytelling freedom in the world of Ver.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dice-and-jargon"><a class="header" href="#dice-and-jargon">Dice, and Jargon</a></h1>
<h2 id="dice"><a class="header" href="#dice">Dice</a></h2>
<p>It is common in tabletop roleplaying games, such as Tales of Ver, to introduce
some amount of randomness through the game using dice. In Tales of Ver we use
two different types of dice to introduce randomness. The 6 sided dice, and the
20 sided dice. It is common to refrence these die as “1d6” for 1, 6 sided die,
and “1d20” for 1, 20 sided die.To expand this notation, we can say something
like “3d6” for 3, 6 sided die, or “5d20” for 5, 20 sided die.</p>

<p>The following chapters will take you through what you need to create a
character. This section is helpful for if you are creating a character, or if
you need a refresher on how some of the rules of your character work.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sculpting-a-body--personality"><a class="header" href="#sculpting-a-body--personality">Sculpting a Body &amp; Personality</a></h1>
<p>What is a character? On a character sheet a character is a collection of stats,
skills, talents, and items, representing what the character is good and bad at.
In a story a character is a collection of values, goals, beliefs, and
potentially a sense of justice. It represents a person. This is what you should
set out to build when creating a character in Ver.</p>
<p>When crafting your character the game will guide you through finding out what
you are good at (and what you are bad at), but it is up to you to really shape
your character. Ask yourself questions like why you are good at weilding a
sword, or why you can chop a tree down really well. These will guide you nicely
into a character that feels whole and complete. Be hesitant to fill in every
detail though, one of the joys of roleplaying is discovering parts about your
character you never knew as the story develops.</p>
<p>The game will give you strengths and weaknesses, a fun character will have just
as interesting strengths as weaknesses. Lean into your strengths, if you are
good with a sword, then enter competitions, or train others, let it help define
you. Similarly, if you cannot barter whatsoever, then perhaps shopping is a big
hobby of yours, or you’ve always wanted to open a shop for yourself. Leaning
into your strengths will make you feel incredible, and leaning into your
weaknesses will have you laughing hard.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Be sure to think of your character as a real person, rather than a collection
of statistics. Ask yourself questions about why you’re good at different things.
Lean into your strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-character-sheet">What is a Character Sheet</a></h1>
<p>A character sheet is a tool for you to remember all the information about your
character. This can be whatever works best for you; a piece of paper, a
spreadsheet, an encrypted document. We have provided a character sheet pdf file
with most everything you need if you’d like to use it, but don’t feel compelled
to. Regardless of what you use, be sure to keep good track of this, especially
if you’re recording it non-digitally.</p>
<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>A Character sheet is where you keep track of the various statistics for your
character. You can use the provided PDF file, or create your own.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="character-progression"><a class="header" href="#character-progression">Character Progression</a></h1>
<p>Characters start at Level 1 with 0 Tales. Level and Tales are the two different
ways that your character grows. Level growth represents your character’s core
features, and their growth as a person. While Tales represent your stories, and
give you strange traits to make your character distinct.</p>
<h2 id="levels"><a class="header" href="#levels">Levels</a></h2>
<p>Levels range from 1 to 12, and are given out as your character does noteworthy
things. ToV is a narrative game, and your character will be given levels by the
GM, when natural story beats happen. For instance, finishing the mystery you’ve
been investigating, or overthrowing the evil dictator of a kingdom. Levels are
given out after the climax.</p>
<p>Levels themselves control nearly every part of your character. They control,
your skills max rank, your defense values, your attributes, and more. What this
means is that the difference between levels is important, and a level 3 is for
the most part strictly better than a level 1 or 2. Finally, due to the
compounding factors, levels strength seems to grow exponentially. The difference
between a level 1 character and level 2 is minor, while the difference between a
level 11 and level 12 is a large gap. Keep this in mind when thinking about the
scope, as a group of level 4 characters will be helping to save villages, while
a level 8 character will be helping to save countries, and a level 12 character
will be helping to save the plane.</p>
<p>Because levels determine so many things, here is a helpful table to see what
different values are at different levels. You can also find this data in the
<a href="creating-a-character/./leveling-up.html">Leveling Up</a> page, which tells you precisely what you have to
do between levels.</p>

<h2 id="tales"><a class="header" href="#tales">Tales</a></h2>
<p>Tales are a resource which can be used to purchase <a href="creating-a-character/./traits.html">traits</a>. They
are a currency which represents how many interesting stories you’ve accumulated
as an adventurer.</p>
<p>You’ll be given tales as interesting things happen,and the number of tales you
get may be proportional to the rarity of the event, and the long lasting
character impact. Fighting an <em>Instres Demon</em> is probably worth a tale, but
getting your eye’s gauged out by that demon definitely is worth 2 or 3 tales.</p>
<p>Unlike levels, Tales can vary more per player without breaking the balance of
the game, meaning a GM can feel comfortable in giving some players more Tales
than others, that said GM’s should strive to keep players around the same number
of Tales, and to about 5 tales per level.</p>
<p>Finally, a note for GMs. Since Tales are a currency you can feel comfortable
using them for in game things. Perhaps there are a race of creatures which trade
in tales, hungry for stories of adventures, and willing to part with valuables
to hear them. Or maybe you want to homebrew a rule about how the players can
spend tales to improve the reputation of the adventuring guild, gaining access
to more interesting quests, and bigger rewards. Just note that if you do this
you may have to give out more tales to ensure that players can get the traits
they want.</p>
<h2 id="starting-at-higher-levels"><a class="header" href="#starting-at-higher-levels">Starting at Higher Levels</a></h2>
<p>If you and your group decide not to start at Level 1 (not an uncommon thing to
do), you can simply make level 1 characters and then go through the process of
leveling them up as many times as desired. Though there are a couple of
resources you should also gain more of</p>
<p>Firstly, players should have some number of tales, as a rule of thumb, give
players about 5 tales per level past level 1. This means players starting at
level 3 will have around 10 tales to grab some interesting traits with.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you are using the <a href="creating-a-character/./commerce.html">Commerce System</a> consider if your
characters should start at a higher wealth. If you are having trouble figuring
out where to put the players, you can generally base their commerce rank off of
their Skill Rank Cap. Since, at level 6 you have a Skill Rank Cap of 3, then
maybe the wealth should be Skilled Laborer(3). This is a much looser rule than
the already loose tales rule, and should vary greatly from player to player, and
game to game. Below is a table with rough starting values for higher levels</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>Also keep in mind the amount of history, and notoriety your character has should
make sense for your Level. A Level 1 represents potential, your first few
adventures, A Level 3 or higher character though is likely somewhat established.
Think about what they did to get where they are now, who they hurt and helped
in doing so, and how they are known in the world around them.</p>
<h2 id="summary-2"><a class="header" href="#summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Levels range from 1 to 12, and you start at level 1. Levels influence almost
every part of your character. Meanwhile, tales are the adventures you’ve been
on, and can be used to purchase traits. If starting at higher make sure to
adjust levels as well as wealth to match.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="your-race"><a class="header" href="#your-race">Your Race</a></h1>
<p>Your race is a key part of your character and lays out for you how you’ll
determine your <a href="creating-a-character/./attributes.html">Attributes</a>, and
<a href="creating-a-character/./defense.html">Defense Values</a>, as well as give you Languages, and a powerful
Racial ability. If this is your first time reading about the game, it is
recommended you look at attributes and defenses <em>first</em> before choosing your
race, as it will help you make a more informed decision about the impacts on
your character.</p>
<h2 id="race-rarity"><a class="header" href="#race-rarity">Race Rarity</a></h2>
<p>The primary way of distinguishing between races is rarity. Every race is either
common, uncommon, or rare. This doesn’t have much of an impact except that
uncommon and rare races are seen less often in the world, be that because they
only exist in certain geographical areas, or because their status in the world
causes them to live particular lifestyles.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay common races are more inviting for new players, having less
mechanically heavy racials, more forgiving defenses, and incorporating into the
world easily. Listed below are some common races we recommend checking out on
your first time playing. If you are a returning player--or just want to be
experimental--you can look at <a href="creating-a-character/../races/uncommon.html">Uncommon Races</a> or <a href="creating-a-character/../races/rare.html">Rare
Races</a>. Or you can look at the related races under any of the
listed races below. Finally you can find more common races in <a href="creating-a-character/../races/common.html">Common
Races</a></p>
<h2 id="example-races"><a class="header" href="#example-races">Example Races</a></h2>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="attributes"><a class="header" href="#attributes">Attributes</a></h1>
<p>Attributes are your character’s core stats, and are the simplest distillation of
your character’s capabilities. There are 6 Attributes each with scores which
range from -6 to 6. When your character does something that requires a die
roll you will always add one of these Attributes to the result, along with any
<a href="creating-a-character/../gameplay/circumstance.html">circumstancial bonuses or penalties</a>.</p>
<h2 id="vigor-vig"><a class="header" href="#vigor-vig">Vigor (VIG)</a></h2>
<p>Vigor is your raw strength, and physical limits of your body. It allows you to
become a walking tank, wielding great weapons like Long bows, Great Axes, and
Halberds. Crush stone with your bare hands and break down doors with your bare
feet. Higher Vigor will let you chop down trees in a single blow, pick up 10m
high stone statues, and win every game of tug o’ war. Lower Vigor leaves you
meek and fragile, easy to wound, and struggling to carry the groceries home from
the market.</p>
<h2 id="dexterity-dex"><a class="header" href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity (DEX)</a></h2>
<p>Dexterity is how well you can control your own body. It increases your reflexes
and ability to dodge physical attacks. It allows you to move quickly and
precisely, balancing on thin rafters, moving silently, performing elaborate
dances and disabling deadly traps. You can use lighter weapons like Daggers,
Short bows, and Spears. High Dexterity will let you slip past the palace guards
unnoticed and remove ancient golden idols from their pressure plates without
triggering the boulder trap. Low Dexterity will cause you to slip and stumble
over even the smallest obstacles and accidentally drop the measuring cup of
water as you move it from the water basin to the mixing bowl.</p>
<h2 id="education-edu"><a class="header" href="#education-edu">Education (EDU)</a></h2>
<p>Education is your learned knowledge and learning ability. It allows you to learn
more Skills and Languages, and remember important bits of trivia as well as
where you parked your horse drawn carriage. It also encompasses known academic
knowledge, and can be used to identify magic, alchemy, and technological items.
Some types of magic also rely on Education. High Education will turn you into a
walking library of facts, drawing upon the esoteric techniques of the worlds
greatest minds. Low Education will have you scratching your head in confusion,
getting lost, and struggling to remember which berries you should and shouldn’t
be eating.</p>
<h2 id="cognition-cog"><a class="header" href="#cognition-cog">Cognition (COG)</a></h2>
<p>Cognition is your raw mental processing power, and the ability to adapt to
unfamiliar circumstances and think on your feet. It lets you win debates with
sound logic, and outwit your opponents using new and innovative strategies.
Cognition is also important for application of some academics, such as high
level mathematics, mechanics, magic, and alchemy. Cognition is also used to
compile clues into conclusions, predict what people will do next, and cast some
types of magic. High Cognition will turn you into a mastermind of prediction and
reasoning, solving crimes and picking apart your enemies schemes as if they were
toddlers. Low Cognition leaves you vulnerable to even the simples tricks and
logical fallacies and will make any kind of mental exertion simply exhausting.</p>
<h2 id="resolve-res"><a class="header" href="#resolve-res">Resolve (RES)</a></h2>
<p>Resolve is your strength of will and ability to manipulate your own spirit and
emotions. It allows you to regenerate faster, get back up after getting knocked
down, and protects you from mental and spiritual intrusions. It also represents
your emotional stability and self confidence, which is essential in getting
others to put their confidence in you. Resolve can also weaponize your own
emotion through personal mementos, allowing you to harm enemies, or protect
allies, and manipulate your own spirit to attack or hide your presence. Many
gods look for followers with high resolve and grant them their powers. High
Resolve will let you gain the trust of the masses, and stand firm in the face of
certain defeat. Low Resolve will have you cringing away from even minor wounds,
and leave you vulnerable to coercion.</p>
<h2 id="connection-cnt"><a class="header" href="#connection-cnt">Connection (CNT)</a></h2>
<p>Connection and ability to manipulate and perceive the spirits of other
creatures. It allows you to manipulate social situations, and get a better read
on people around you. It also represents how attuned you are with the Bond, a
spiritual network which connects every living thing. This can allow you to sense
nearby spirits, use special Idols to mentally attack and manipulate targets, and
use musical instruments to create wide reaching spiritual buffs and effects.
Connection also allows you to maintain and use more spiritually imbued items at
once. High Connection will charm others, out barter the owner of the local
pawnshop, or detect the spirits of living things through walls and hiding
places. Low Connection will render you socially awkward, and make it difficult
for you to notice and understand other living things.</p>
<h2 id="attributes-as-you-level"><a class="header" href="#attributes-as-you-level">Attributes as You Level</a></h2>
<p>When making a character your starting attributes are determined by your race,
and can vary wildly. Though most common races will have some variant of rolling
1d6-5 six times, and choosing what stat to put them in, then adding one more
point on top.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="creating-a-character/../races/common.html#Vincals">Vincals</a> roll 1d6-5 six times,
rerolling their lowest and highest rolls, then distributing their points. On the
other hand <a href="creating-a-character/../races/uncommon.html#Goblins">Goblins</a> start with -4 in every stat,
and may choose to add 1d6 to any stat at the cost of a goblin point. The more
goblin points a Goblin has, the stronger their racial is.</p>
<p>There are caps to how high an attribute can be at any given level determined by
the table below. Bonuses to your ATT cannot exceed this limit unless explicitly
stated. It can be calculated as half your level rounded down.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th><th align="right"></th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
<p>Finally, you add 1 to any attribute of your choosing when you level up, of
course this cannot exceed the ATT cap at your new level.</p>
<h2 id="summary-3"><a class="header" href="#summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>The Attributes are the core of your character, split into 6 different
statistics. They are: Vigor: Your strength and athletic abilities. Dexterity:
Your precision and agility. Education: Your memory and academic knowledge.
Cognition: Your mental prowess and intuition. Resolve: Your spiritual strength
and self confidence. Connection: Your social aptitude, and spiritual perception.</p>
<p>When you first create your character your race will determine how to calculate
your attributes. After that you will add 1 to any of your attributes whenever
you level up, never going above your attribute cap, which is half your level
rounded down.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="languages"><a class="header" href="#languages">Languages</a></h1>
<p>Languages are the various ways creatures can communicate in Ver. By default you
get</p>
<p>\[ 3+\frac{EDU}{3}\]</p>
<p>Language slots. The minimum number of language slots is 2. meaning even at -6
COG  you have 2 language slots.</p>
<p>Learning languages. Your race will give you one or more languages you have
learned. You know these. After that you have to learn languages on your own. Any
language can be learned by studying a Language’s tome for 5 weeks. Or being
taught by a professor for 168 hours (3 weeks).</p>
<p>Common is the exception. Common can be learned at character creation for free,
or picked up by being with people speaking common for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Below are short descriptions of some languages.</p>
<h2 id="common"><a class="header" href="#common">Common</a></h2>
<p>Common is the language of Ver, spoken by most creatures in Ver. This
language was originally the language of the Kalics, but over time it has
incorporated many different language’s words. Different creatures’ accents
influence the style of common they speak very heavily, and there are many words
for the same concept.</p>
<h2 id="dwarvish"><a class="header" href="#dwarvish">Dwarvish</a></h2>
<p>The language of the dwarves, dwarvish is a hard brash language. The
language echoes well, and the primary dwarven accent allows for most words to be
yelled with ease.</p>
<h2 id="floran"><a class="header" href="#floran">Floran</a></h2>
<p>Spoken by many creatures of the forest, floran uses a lot of body
language, and various sounds to mean the same thing so that many different
creatures can speak it. Some words in floran are even communicated through
scent.</p>
<h2 id="goran"><a class="header" href="#goran">Goran</a></h2>
<p>The language of the Goran, music is at its core. Goran has a specific
cadence, and messing it up can mean saying something very different.</p>
<h2 id="lingvo"><a class="header" href="#lingvo">Lingvo</a></h2>
<p>A language created by the Teleks to replace their old language. Lingvo
is incredibly regular, and easy to pronounce, but has very specific compound
words for describing exactly what you want.</p>
<h2 id="nomadic"><a class="header" href="#nomadic">Nomadic</a></h2>
<p>A language of traders, and adventurers, Nomadic has its roots in many
languages, primarily Goran, Dwarvish, and Floran.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="skills"><a class="header" href="#skills">Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are the things that your character can do that you can’t just pick up and
learn in a day or two. Skills are things like cooking food, fighting with a
longsword, and enchanting magical items. They are things like playing chess, and
haggling, and lifting weights. Skills are highly</p>
<p>customizable and can be made to be either very general, such as taking a skill
in all Athletic activities, or incredibly specific, like a Trivia skill focusing
only on the anatomy of vampire bats. The more specific a skill is, the higher a
bonus it will grant you. Each skill is linked to a single ATT and can only be
used in a Skill Check that is also using that ATT.</p>
<h1 id="component-skills"><a class="header" href="#component-skills">Component Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are made of different parts called Components pulled from the table
below, which will designate what the Skill is used for and how specific the
Skill is. Each Component has a value associated with it and the total of all the
Component’s values is the Skill’s Bonus. More Components means a more specific
Skill and a higher ending Bonus. You can make a Skill with as few or as many
Components as you like, and are encouraged to talk with your GM if you aren’t
sure how to make the Skill you want with what is available in the base game.</p>
<p>You and your GM are encouraged to invent components that don’t exist to fit your
character’s playstyle and background. When creating new Components you should
look at Components with the same Bonus and ask if the new component you are
Creating provides about the same level of specificity, or is very similar to
pre-existing Components. For instance ‘Joy’ and ‘Anger’ are +4 CNT Components,
so ‘Grief’ would be a reasonable +4 Component as well.</p>
<p>The first component to any Skill is its Base. A Skill Base will determine the
breadth of the Skill (what all it can be used for) as well as its relevant ATT,
and grant a starting Bonus. The ‘Athletics’ Base for instance is a VIG Base that
grants a +2 Bonus. Any Skill with the Athletics Base then can be used to perform
Athletic activities such as running, exercising, climbing, swimming, and so on.</p>
<p>All other Components will restrict the Skill and make it more specific in
exchange for a higher Bonus. After Athletics you could take ‘Climbing’ for a +2
Bonus which would only allow you to do Athletics activities related to Climbing.
From there you could take  ‘While Inebriated’ for a +3 Bonus and ‘Axe’ for a +2
Bonus. Now you have the Skill: ‘Athletics, Climbing, While Inebriated, Axe’ with
a total Bonus of +9, but to apply it to a Skill Check you must be Climbing,
while drunk, and using an Axe to help you climb.</p>
<p>It should be noted that being drunk and using an axe to climb a cliff may make
the climb more difficult, and apply Circumstantial penalties to you, so you
should be careful before you pile on too many extra Components to your Skills.
Be sure to communicate with your GM about the Skills you have, how you want them
to work, and in what situations would the GM apply Circumstantial penalties to
you, because while climbing a stone cliff with an axe while drunk might be
harder than doing it normally, having an axe and a bit of liquid courage might
help in climbing an icy cliff with a horrifyingly long drop beneath it.</p>

<h1 id="buying-and-upgrading-skills"><a class="header" href="#buying-and-upgrading-skills">Buying and Upgrading Skills</a></h1>
<p>Skills are bought using LP and have a Rating associated them. The first time you
buy a Skill it costs 1 LP, and has a Rating of Lousy (1). You can then upgrade
this to a Unremarkable (2) Rating for 2 additional LP. Then 3 LP to upgrade to
Great (3) and so on. The Bonus a skill provides is equal to its initial bonus
multiplied by its Rating. So a Great (3) Skill with a +5 Bonus grants a +15
Bonus and so on. You can only upgrade a Skill to a certain Rating depending on
your Level as outlined in this table:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th align="left">Level</th><th align="left">Max Rating</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>You can only have a certain number of different  Background and Component skills
based on your EDU. This is your Skill Cap and it is:</p>
<p>\[ 4+\frac{EDU}{3} \]</p>
<p>At Level 1, you start with two Unremarkable Background skills, and one
Unremarkable Component skill.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-and-constitution-skills"><a class="header" href="#weapon-and-constitution-skills">Weapon and Constitution Skills</a></h2>
<p>Weapons and Constitutions significantly change what your character can do, but
require a bit of know-how to use. If you do not have an applicable Skill, but
attempt to perform a Skill Check that uses a weapon or constitution, you take a
Circumstance -10 penalty.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that not all weapons can use all Constitutions or the
same ATT. For instance, you cannot use Artisan’s Implements with the Delight
Constitution and so a Skill in ‘Delight Constitution, Artisan’s Impments’ is
effectively useless.</p>
<p>You can find what Constitutions a weapon can be used with in the Weapon
documents or under Component Definitions, the last section on this page.</p>

<h2 id="skill-checks"><a class="header" href="#skill-checks">Skill Checks</a></h2>
<p>While most things your character does will not require a roll--like eating
breakfast, opening a door, or walking down the street--the important things you
do will. When you’re faced with climbing a sheer cliff, trying to decapitate a
charging orc, or attempting to charm your way into a party without an
invitation you will need to make a Skill check.</p>
<p>When performing a Skill Check, first you roll 1d20, then add:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relevant ATT score</li>
<li>Add up to one Skill which is applicable to what you’re trying to do and
matches the ATT being used</li>
<li>The Bonus of up to one piece of equipment (weapon or tool) you’re using to
perform the Skill Check.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have a Skill which can be applied to a Skill check you will still
apply one ATT score, though you’re welcome to bargain with the GM as to which
one it should be.</p>
<p>After you have rolled your die, and added your ATT and Skill the GM will
describe how your attempt turns out in line with the rating system described in
The Basics. So a result of 1-10 will be an Unremarkable attempt, 11-20 a Good
attempt, and so forth. In the case that your attempt is not enough-- for
instance a Good try at climbing a Legendary cliff--you have failed or in some
way only half succeeded.</p>
<p>Fail or succeed, a Skill Check will always advance the story, have real
consequences, and can not be immediately repeated by either you or another
character. If you fail to climb the cliff you may fall and break your leg,
causing the party to need to set camp, and set your leg back in place. Or you
may catch yourself halfway through the fall and find an entrance to a cave
tunnel which allows you to find a different, longer way to the top. Or you may
make it partway up the cliff, and realize that you could climb the rest of the
way, but it would take you twice as long to do so as you initially thought it
would. You will not, however make it halfway up the cliff and then need to make
a second identical roll to make it the rest of the way. Skill checks, whether
they fail or succeed, are made a single time, and advance the story.</p>
<h2 id="circumstance"><a class="header" href="#circumstance">Circumstance</a></h2>
<p>When performing a Skill check you can gain a bonus or penalty to your roll
called Circumstance, based on temporary or situational things that either aid
or hinder your attempt. If you’re attacking a target and another ally is
flanking and distracting them this could grant you a Circumstance bonus. If you
had sprained your wrist and were using a sword on the same attack you could
take a Circumstance penalty. Circumstance is always given in ranks of plus or
minus 5, 10, 15, 20, etc, and players are encouraged to ask about and suggest
giving out Circumstantial bonuses while playing.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Circumstance is always given to the person performing a
Skill check. So if a person is taking cover from an archer behind a stump, then
the archer takes a Circumstance penalty to their attack, instead of the
defender gaining a circumstance bonus to their defense.</p>
<h3 id="critical-failure-and-success"><a class="header" href="#critical-failure-and-success">Critical Failure, and Success</a></h3>
<p>When performing a Skill Check if you roll either a 1, or a 20, on your 1d20,
then your attempt either Critically Failed (in the case of a 1) or Critically
Succeeded (in the case of a 20). In the case of a Critical Failure treat a roll
of 1 as a -10, and regardless of the total result your action will go awry, or
fail outright in some way. In the case of a Success, treat the 20 as a 30, and
regardless of the total result your action will succeed in some spectacular
way, at least partially. After either of these take place the GM will put down
a square of Empowered Ground nearby, a type of special Terrain (see Terrain
Below) that will grant Circumstance to anyone who stands in it.</p>
<h2 id="attacks"><a class="header" href="#attacks">Attacks</a></h2>
<p>While many Skill Checks will be made against static things which cannot defend
themselves, such as cliffs that need climbing, doors that need bashing, and
locks that need picking, an equal amount will be made charming guards, killing
nobles, and teleporting goblins off of cliffs. In this case the Skill Chec is
considered an attack and target will defend against it as outlined in the next
section, Defense.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Attacks made from stealth--or on targets otherwise
unaware or unable to defend themselves--will gain Circumstance or will bypass
defense. Usually a totally unaware or helpless target will be treated as
without defense, while an alert but unaware target will still get their
defense, but the attacker will gain Circumstance.</p>
<h3 id="contests"><a class="header" href="#contests">Contests</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a Contest between two targets, such as arm-wrestling, playing
cards, or the like, then both parties should perform a Skill Check and the
higher one wins out.</p>
<h2 id="summary-4"><a class="header" href="#summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Every time you roll a die to perform an Action it is a Skill Check. While
making a Skill you first add an applicable ATT, any Circumstantial modifiers,
and then may add up to one applicable Skill, and the Bonus from up to one tool
or weapon you are using to perform the Skill Check. Fail or succeed, your Skill
Check will move the story forward and cannot be repeated or attempted a second
time.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="defense"><a class="header" href="#defense">Defense</a></h1>
<p>Keeping yourself alive and in good physical and emotional health is a
prerequisite for any and all other adventures you might undertake. Take care of
yourself out there.</p>
<h2 id="toughness"><a class="header" href="#toughness">Toughness</a></h2>
<p>Toughness is your general wellbeing and represents your resistance to suffering
major injuries. Your Max Toughness is determined by your Body Type and VIG, and
represents your ability to withstand injury after a Good Night’s Rest. A person
fresh to battle with full toughness may well shrug off an attack that would have
done serious damage to someone who was already exhausted, and suffering from
other minor injuries. As you fight you will lose Toughness by being hit
physically, but it also accounts for your mental and emotional well being.
Emotional suffering or discomfort can also cause you to lose Toughness.
Toughness usually regenerates fully every time you rest, but long lasting
effects such as lingering wounds, poisons, diseases, or failing to take care of
your bodily needs can cause you to temporarily lose Max Toughness until they are
resolved.</p>
<h2 id="defense-types"><a class="header" href="#defense-types">Defense Types</a></h2>
<p>Your character has an array of different defense stats which can make them
highly resistant against some types of attack, but vulnerable to others. These
defenses fall into three general groups, each of which corresponds to an
Attribute: Dexterous Defense with DEX, Cognitive Defense with COG, and Resolve
Defense with RES. Specifically they are:</p>
<h3 id="dexterous"><a class="header" href="#dexterous">Dexterous:</a></h3>
<p><strong>Escape</strong>, for escaping a grapple, falling into a pit trap, or holding your
balance in a wind.</p>
<p><strong>Blunt</strong>, for hard impacts, heavy clubs, blasts of force, and rolling boulders.</p>
<p><strong>Cut</strong>, for bladed and piercing weapons, being impaled on a wall of spikes,
swords, shards of ice.</p>
<h3 id="cognitive"><a class="header" href="#cognitive">Cognitive:</a></h3>
<p><strong>Thaumic</strong>, for resisting manifested magic, lightning bolts, fireballs, and
enchanted weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Null</strong>, for nullifying magic that directly targets you, teleportation, slowing
and paralysing magic.</p>
<p>**Wit, **for defending against trickery and deceit in debate, the streets, the
battlefield, and beyond.</p>
<h3 id="resolve"><a class="header" href="#resolve">Resolve:</a></h3>
<p><strong>Resilience</strong>, for resisting a direct spiritual assault, or bodily
transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Aegis</strong>, for resisting physical manifestations of spiritual effects, divine
smites, and necrosis.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>, for resisting emotional and mental duress, alterations, and attempts
to control.</p>
<p>Sometimes it may make sense to record bonuses for subsets of specific defense. A
magical potion might, for instance, only grant a resistance to heat, but not
cold. In this case it wouldn’t increase Thaumic Defense, instead you would note
the bonus elsewhere on your character sheet and apply it when defending against
a heat attack.</p>
<p>These defense types are based on your <a href="gameplay/../creating-a-character/body-type.html">Body
Type</a>, and you can find their starting
value on that page.</p>
<h2 id="defending-against-attacks"><a class="header" href="#defending-against-attacks">Defending Against Attacks</a></h2>
<p>When targeted by a hostile effect, be it magic or an axe swing, you will have a
chance to defend yourself before it hits. First determine what kind of attack it
is, and what defense type you will need to use to defend against it. This is
usually fairly obvious, but your GM will make the final call if it is needed.
Then take the final value of the effect and subtract the Defence Type which best
applies.</p>
<p>If the remaining number is less than or equal to 0, you successfully block,
avoid, or resist the effect. If the remaining value is greater than 0 you have
been hit or the effect has taken hold. If the remaining value is also greater
than your current Toughness you gain a Wound, a severe injury with possibly long
lasting consequences. This is a lingering debuff which is detailed by the GM,
wounds are explained more later. If the remaining value is, however, less
thanyour remaining Toughness then one of two things can happen.</p>
<p>If the effect does not do direct harm to your character (does not remove
Toughness) it takes effect normally. If the effect is directly damaging you lose
Toughness equal to the Shred stat of the effect (usually dictated by the weapon
it was made with).</p>
<h2 id="spirit-sense"><a class="header" href="#spirit-sense">Spirit Sense</a></h2>
<p>When someone attempts to be stealthy around unaware targets this is treated as
an attack made against their Spirit Sense, plus any one relevant skill that you
have (such as Empathy, Perception, Disguise Detection, etc). This will usually
be done privately by the GM without the defender’s knowledge, unless they
successfully ‘defend’ against the deception. Spirit Sense is \(10 + CNT\)</p>
<h2 id="summary-5"><a class="header" href="#summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<p>There are nine different types of defense. Cut, Blunt, Escape, Thaumic, Null,
Wit, Resilience, Agis, and Will. All of which are used to defend against
different types of attacks. You will have to choose carefully which of these
defense types you want to be well protected against, and will likely always have
one or two glaring vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>When you are attacked subtract your relevant Defense from the incoming attack.
If this reduces it below zero the attack misses or is ineffective. If the attack
is greater than zero and greater than your current Toughness, you suffer a
Wound. If the attack is greater than zero and less than your current Toughness,
you loose Toughness equal to the Attack’s Shred value.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fortification"><a class="header" href="#fortification">Fortification</a></h1>
<p>It is, barring divine or draconic intervention, impossible to instantaneously
heal a person’s wounds, or restore Toughness. Instead of healing, holy priests,
and other defenders of the meak work to prevent damage from being done in the
first place.</p>
<p>They do this by granting Fortification, a temporary but powerful boost to a
Specific Defense Type. The form this takes is dependent on its source. Thermal
Fortification granted by Wordix may take the shape of a halo of golden fire, and
Cut Fortification may look like a shimmering sphere of light. Fortification
effects made with RES can grant any type of Fortification, but more than just
RES effects can create Fortification.</p>
<p>An ice mage for instance, may be able to grant Fortification against heat by
chilling a target, and a mentalist may be able to do the same for Duress. In
these cases however you should always be clear how you’re granting the
Fortification, to ensure it makes narrative sense, and record it as exactly what
it is. So Fortification against heat granted from an ice mage should be noted as
such, and not added to Thermal Defense.</p>
<p>Fortification lasts until its recipient has taken one full turn. Below is a
table outlining the amount of Fortification an effect grants to a single target
based on its Rating. If you want to split this among multiple targets, or make
it last longer, you should consult your GM.</p>

<p>getting hurt in the first place. Fortification is a powerful bonus applied to
one Specific Defense Type and lasts until the target has taken one full turn.
Most RES effects can always grant any type of Fortification, but anyone can
grant Fortification if they can make a reasonable case for how they’re doing it.</p>

<h2 id="genres"><a class="header" href="#genres">Genres</a></h2>
<h3 id="genre-push"><a class="header" href="#genre-push">Genre, Push</a></h3>
<p>Requires rating of Beginner (1). Force can be applied to an object as a directional vector, which pushes on them from their center of mass. The push on its own is not strong enough to harm, but contact with things flung, or flung things contacting solid things can deal toughness.</p>
<p>The reaction of pushing is for the caster to have the same force applied to them in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>Precision</strong>: Requires rating of Intermediate (2). The push can  be on a specific part of an object rather than at the center of the object’s mass. The reaction on the caster is placed in a place similar to the place on the object. For example an elf pushing the head of a gnome, would push the elf’s head in the opposite direction. Pushing the top left of a door could push the top left of the caster.</p>
<h3 id="genre-barrier"><a class="header" href="#genre-barrier">Genre, Barrier</a></h3>
<p>Requires rating of Intermediate (2). A piece of space can be marked as a barrier, creating an incredibly strong, nearly invisible blockade. The more complex a barrier is, the smaller it must be. More technically, the more vertices which define the shape, the closer those vertices must be together. While barriers are nearly invisible, an opponent with strong wit will be able to predict and see a barrier.</p>
<p>The barrier is incredibly strong, and one would have to hit it with an effect an order of magnitude stronger than the casters abilities in order to break it.</p>
<p>Barriers must form a solid, meaning they cannot have hollow insides. This is because you must be able to travel along the edges from one vertex to every other vertex</p>
<p>The reaction of defining a barrier is that the caster is rendered immobile. Bodily functions such as breathing and blinking continue. This only impacts the caster’s own ability though, as they can be tipped over, moved, carried, or knocked around as normal.</p>

<p>The Dragon of Ice demands sacrifice, in exchange for power. Each effect must be fueled by either emotional or physical suffering. Self sacrifice is preferred, but Issandren will accept the suffering of others if inflicted by the caster.</p>
<p>Default rates are that any effect of Beginner (1) or greater, requires at least 1 Toughness worth of suffering.</p>
<p>Noteworthy sacrifices, such as cutting open your own palm, or killing a captive instead of merely wounding them, will increase the reliability of your effects. The default going rate for self inflicted physical damage is 1 Toughness to +2 Circumstance.</p>
<h2 id="genres-1"><a class="header" href="#genres-1">Genres</a></h2>
<h3 id="genre-form-ice"><a class="header" href="#genre-form-ice">Genre, Form Ice:</a></h3>
<p>Requires Rating of Beginner (1). Form large amounts of ice sprouting off of a solid surface with which you are in physical contact. The initial formation of this ice is fast enough to inflict damage. The strength and durability of formed ice is based on the effect’s Rating and scales up to that of steel, but all formed ice will melt in room temperatures, and crumbles to nothing on a timeline of several hours based on its structural integrity.</p>
<p>This Genre is highly sensitive to the range of an effect, and Forming Ice outside of a Close range becomes more difficult.</p>
<h3 id="genre-manipulate-ice"><a class="header" href="#genre-manipulate-ice">Genre, Manipulate Ice:</a></h3>
<p>Requires Rating of Intermediate (2). Manipulate ice--either magical or natural--to the caster’s will. At rudimentary levels this can be used to create and throw projectiles, but can eventually be used to form rudimentary constructs, and carefully sculpt ice into any shape desired.</p>
<h2 id="addendums-1"><a class="header" href="#addendums-1">Addendums</a></h2>
<h3 id="addendum-grand-sacrifice"><a class="header" href="#addendum-grand-sacrifice">Addendum, Grand Sacrifice:</a></h3>
<p>Requires Rating of Advanced (3). Truly magnificent and irreversible sacrifices--the killing of a loved one, cutting off your own finger, hand, or limb, yield wondrous effects. The rating of an effect cast in this way is increased by either one or two, and gains Circumstance +8.</p>
<p>All ice either formed or manipulated in this way gains either a brilliant blue (for emotional sacrifice) or red (for physical sacrifice) color.</p>
<p>Grand Sacrifice also alters the Genres of Form Ice, and Animate Ice:</p>
<p>Form Ice creates ice which is marvelously durable and does not melt, crumble, or age with time. It can also be created with the precision of Manipulate Ice, without requiring another effect to be cast. It does however, dissolve upon the death of the original caster, unless their Grand Sacrifice was sacrificing their own life, in which case it will remain and is, for all intents and purposes, indestructible.
Animate Ice can be used to create lingering effects and ice affected will not melt or crumble like normal. It can be used to create functional prosthetics, perpetual blizzards, permanently animated ice sculptures, and so forth.</p>
<h2 id="example-use-1"><a class="header" href="#example-use-1">Example Use</a></h2>
<p>Intermediate (2) Caster uses Form Ice and cuts their palm, trading 1 Toughness for +2 Circumstance. Their effect succeeds and they summon a jagged wall of ice from the ground before them, stabbing and pushing back the bandit. Wounded, the bandit begins to flee. Intermediate (2) Caster waves their hand and uses Manipulate Ice to break off a dozen shards of ice from their wall and hurl them into the bandit’s back.</p>

<h3 id="precept-mindscape"><a class="header" href="#precept-mindscape">Precept, Mindscape:</a></h3>
<p>Mentalists classify most minds into three distinct parts. The Mental Surface (or
Dermis), the Mental Bulk, and the Mental Anchor. All mental effects require a
subtle navigation of these layers.</p>
<p>The Mental Surface is made of current thoughts, physical sensory input, and
short term memory. It changes rapidly.</p>
<p>The Mental Bulk holds lingering ideas, long term memories, opinions, and
important but nonessential mental material. It is largely static but does change
on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The Mental Anchor links Mind with Body and Spirit. It is extraordinarily
dangerous and difficult (beyond the abilities of most mentalists) to access and
contains ideas that are core to a person’s identity. It can change, but only
rarely. So called ‘Mind Death’ as it is known, occurs when this Anchor is
broken.</p>
<h3 id="precept-scarring"><a class="header" href="#precept-scarring">Precept, Scarring:</a></h3>
<p>All entrance or manipulation of another targets Mental Bulk or Mental Anchor
leaves Scarring, which can be detected by mentalists and bears a ‘tone of voice’
which is unique to each mentalist. A mentalist manipulating their own Mindscape
will leave similar scars, but they will be almost completely undetectable,
especially to the mentalist.</p>
<h2 id="genres-2"><a class="header" href="#genres-2">Genres</a></h2>
<h3 id="genre-idea-manipulation"><a class="header" href="#genre-idea-manipulation">Genre, Idea Manipulation:</a></h3>
<p>Requires Rating of Beginner (1). Control over the contents (ideas) within a
particular mental layer. Manipulation of the Mental Surface allows one to
implant trains of thought, short term memories, and even momentary sensory
input. While Manipulation of the Mental Bulk allows for the overwriting or
erasing of memory, or lingering ideas. Idea Manipulation cannot reach the Mental
Anchor.</p>
<p>Idea Manipulation is usually quite subtle, and often goes unnoticed (at least in
the moment of casting) by the unwary.</p>
<p><strong>Meme</strong>: Requires Rating of Advanced (3). Allows the creation of memes. Idea
Manipulation effects which transmit naturally between people who interact with
each other socially. These memes usually sputter out after days to weeks, or
after infecting a certain number of targets, but powerful memes can last for
years or even become permanent.</p>
<p>After casting, treat further transmission as a simple Will attack with Rating
equal to the original Rating. Decrease this as the meme goes further away from
the original infected. Check for transmission when the subject of the Idea
Manipulation is discussed between infected, and non infected.</p>
<p>Targets aware of the supernatural nature of the meme gain +4 Will Defense against
transmission.</p>
<h3 id="genre-convergence"><a class="header" href="#genre-convergence">Genre, Convergence:</a></h3>
<p>Requires Rating of Beginner (1). Allows you to merge mindscapes together, most
easily yours and another single target’s. When used to merge the mental surface,
this allows easy transfer of thoughts and sensory information and, once
initiated, can be maintained over very long distances.</p>
<p>Overlapping mental bodies (or deeper layers) can be performed to transfer large
amounts of memory or information very quickly. But if improperly managed
(intentionally or not) leads to intense confusion and a lingering mixing of
ideas, memories, and sensation.</p>
<p>Convergence is highly sensitive to the number and type of participants.
Specifically participants who are unwilling. Additionally convergence is more
difficult when the mentalist’s mind is not involved in the merging.</p>
<p><strong>Domination</strong>: Requires Rating of Intermediate (2).  Instead of merging with
another target you dominate them instead. Domination over the Mental Surface
allows one to issue primitive commands to the body, while domination over the
Mental Bulk allows for much more complex orders.</p>
<p>Domination usually requires total focus and the mentalist cannot do anything
else while dominating their target. If a mentalist wishes for a target to
continue to obey orders or be effected after they stop concentrating, assume the
effect Rating is increased by two.</p>
<p>Domination over the Mental Anchor represents a total control over a person’s
mind, memories, and ideas about themselves. It is always permanent and allows a
complete rewriting of a person into anything from another person, to a brain
dead thrall. It is an act almost universally despised and outlawed in every
culture and time. Assume any attempt to dominate the Mental Anchor increases an
effect’s Rating by four.</p>
<h2 id="example-use-2"><a class="header" href="#example-use-2">Example Use</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Include example of rebound on a Domination attempt giving the target info on the caster</li>

<p>The traits in this document are focused around companions, familiars, and pets
that help your character.</p>
<p><strong>Has a Pet</strong>, Tales: 2</p>
<p>This trait may only be taken at character creation or at GM discretion.</p>
<p>You have an ordinary pet, partially trained. They are an independent, mortal
creature. A comforting companion.</p>
<p>Choose a commonly domesticated or tamable animal for your pet. They count as an
NPC, and are controlled by the GM. As with any animal, you can perform a CNT
roll or relevant skill check to attempt to command or communicate with them.
Your pet is mortal, it can get sick, injured, and be killed. In the case your
pet has died you may pay 1 tale to gain a new one at GM discretion.</p>
<p>Pets use a simplified stat block with ATTS collapsed into three categories:
Physical (VIG/DEX), Mental (EDU/COG), and Spiritual (CNT/RES); Defensees
collapse into three similar categories: Dexterous, Cognitive, and Resolve.
Determine values with the GM, following these guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total ATT: -2,</li>
<li>Total Defense: -2,</li>
<li>Toughness: 5 - 8,</li>
<li>Tenacity: 2 - 4,</li>

<li>One Beginner (1) Background Skill in being whatever type of creature they are.</li>

the bond between you has been enhanced and transformed them into a stronger
creature.</p>
<p>Choose a somewhat exotic animal, or common magical creature for your familiar.
They count as an NPC and are controlled by the GM, but you can give them basic
commands with a Free action. Your familiar is mortal, it can get sick, injured,
and be killed. In the case your familiar has died you may pay 1 Tale to gain a
new one at GM discretion.</p>
<p>Familiars are more powerful, and your connection is too. Gain your familiar’s
natural language. For a Free action you can sense the general direction and
distance between you and your familiar. Because familiars are strong, determine
a new stat block with your GM based on these guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total ATT: 0,</li>
<li>Total Defense: 1,</li>
<li>Toughness: 8 - 12,</li>
<li>Tenacity: 3 - 6,</li>
<li>Max Wounds: 2,</li>
<li>One Beginner (1) Background Skill in being whatever type of creature they are.</li>
<li>One Intermediate (2) Skill of your choosing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pet Assistant</strong>, Tales: 3, Requires ‘Has a Pet’</p>
<p>When within arms reach of your pet, or familiar, you may choose to have them
assist you with a skill check. The pet loses 1 Toughness as it exerts itself to
help you. You gain a Circumstance bonus equal to your pet’s applicable ATT stat.</p>
<p><strong>Bonded Familiar</strong>, Tales: 3, Requires ‘Has a Pet’</p>
<p>The bond between you and your pet or familiar is extraordinarily strong. With a
Free action you can sense the precise direction and distance between you and
your familiar at any range. While within Close to Far range you can discern your
familiars exact location, status, and communicate telepathically. For a Movement
or Normal action you may meld your and your Familiar’s Mental Surface,
experiencing each other’s current thoughts, sensory input, and short term
memory.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="personality-traits"><a class="header" href="#personality-traits">Personality Traits</a></h1>
<p><strong>Exploitative</strong>, Tales: 4</p>
<p>You are skilled in utilizing even the slightest advantage to destroy your
opponents. Beware that most people don’t enjoy watching you kick someone while
they’re down.</p>
<p>When attacking a target you gain Shred equal to your Circumstance/2. You may not
wound a target unless you have a Circumstantial bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Ominous</strong>, Tales: 5</p>
<p>Something about you is frightful, intimidating or unnerving. Perhaps you are
physically intimidating, or have a horrific birth defect. Perhaps you have
suffered a terrible loss and carry it with you like a dark shroud. Or maybe,
you’ve been cursed.</p>
<p>Most people feel your presence through the Bond. All targets within Medium range
with at least CNT -1 will be made known of your presence and approximate
location.</p>
<p><strong>Tale-Spinner</strong>, Tales: 6</p>
<p>You’ve been around, you know the stories, all of them. Maybe you’re a
professional bard, or storyteller, or maybe you’re just well traveled and have
a knack for remembering these things.</p>
<p>For a Normal Action you may remember a story about a location, person, creature,
culture, item, etc. Begin telling a story about this subject. At some point
pause, and declare that this is all you can remember. Then perform an EDU check
using your Level/2 as your Skill level, and comparing it to the obscurity of the
subject of your story.</p>
<p>If you succeed you’ve remembered the rest of the story. The GM wil pick up the
story where you left it and complete it.</p>
<p>If you fail then you don’t remember, and cannot attempt this ability again
without incurring a circumstantial penalty, until you have taken some time
(usually a Good Night’s Rest) to clear your head.</p>
<p>Note that the effects of this take place in real time, as such you probably
cannot tell a story in the middle of combat, or another time sensitive
encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Cool &amp; Collected</strong>, Tales: 8</p>
<p>You always appear calm, professional, and capable. Perhaps you’re a professional
servant, or politician. Maybe you have nerves of steel, or are perpetually
chilled out.</p>
<p>You project a calming aura onto all targets in Close range. All targets will
begin to feel slightly calmer and more collected. Targets whose Will is less
than your Level/2 will feel this especially strongly, to the point where if they
possess a negative disposition towards you or anyone else, it will be
temporarily lessened by one rank.</p>
<p>This effect is constant, and impacts all targets equally. If a target is used to
your aura they may attempt a RES check gaining circumstantial bonuses based on
their familiarity with you.</p>
<p><strong>Relentless</strong>, Tales: 8</p>
<p>You do not stop, you do not slow, regardless of the cost. Perhaps you are rather
single minded in your pursuits and can focus on little else, or perhaps you have
difficulty accepting defeat.</p>
<p>After a target within your attack range moves out of your attack range for any
reason, you may choose to move up to your movement until they are within range
again, and then gain a Normal action to attack them.</p>
<p>After doing this, all enemies who attack you can choose the result of their d6
rolls, and you cannot use this Trait again until the start of your next turn.
All nearby intelligent enemies will know this.</p>
<p><strong>Socialite</strong>, Tales: 8</p>
<p>You know everyone and everyone knows you. You build reputation easily, both good
and bad, and people remember your face for a long time.</p>
<p>You know and remember the names and identities of people easily, even if you
only head about them tangentially. Similarly people remember your name and
identity easily as well.</p>
<p>People are more likely to gain a strong positive or negative Disposition towards
you, and will be less likely to change their Disposition towards you. When
people do begin to reverse their Disposition towards you, the Disposition
inverts, rather than raising or lowering normally.</p>
<p><strong>Mastermind</strong>, Tales: 10</p>
<p>You are always planning, plotting, scheming. You can never plan for everything
though, and many times will be taken aback by a variable or choice you had not
previously considered.</p>
<p>For a Normal Action you may narrate a flashback talking about how you prepared
for your current situation in a very specific way. This creates an effect with
rating equal to your COG. Flashbacks cannot overlap each other, and using the
ability several times in succession will likely have required a great deal of
past energy and time, resulting in you being exhausted.</p>
<p>Note that you must have had the time and energy to prepare in this way, and the
rating of the effect should be altered by how much time and energy you spent
preparing.</p>
<p>On use you may expend 2 Tales to increase the Rating of your effect by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Steadying</strong>, Tales: 10</p>
<p>When nearby, those around you feel compelled to remain and see things through.
Perhaps you yourself are a very thorough, slow, and steady person, or maybe you
merely inspire this in others.</p>
<p>Subtract 1m from your movement stat. At the end of your turn you must choose one
of the following effects to apply to each adjacent target:</p>
<ul>
<li>+1 Will Fortification</li>
<li>+1 Null Fortification</li>
<li>+1 Escape Fortification</li>
<li>Lose their next movement action.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="field-manipulation-traits"><a class="header" href="#field-manipulation-traits">Field Manipulation Traits</a></h1>
<p><strong>Field Portfolio</strong>, Tales: 4</p>
<p>Increase the radius of your created Fields by 1m. When you roll a critical,
before the GM chooses a location, you may choose between creating an Empowered
Field, or any other type of Field which you possess.</p>
<p><strong>Field Control</strong>, Tales: 4</p>
<p>Whenever the GM places a Field created by you, you may shift its center by 2m in
any direction.</p>
<p><strong>Field Seizure</strong>, Tales: 8</p>
<p>When a willing creature within Medium range created an Empowered Field, you may
apply apply any of your Field traits to their Field creation.</p>
<p><strong>Shady Field</strong>, Tales: 2</p>
<p>When you roll a critical, instead of creating an Empowered Field, you instead
create a Shady Field with radius 1m.</p>
<p>Shady Field: When using a weapon, roll 1d6-2 instead of 1d6. If your result is
less than 1, treat it as 1. Lasts until the end of the current encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Field of Murderous Intent</strong>, Tales: 2</p>
<p>When you roll a critical, instead of creating an Empowered Field, you instead
create a Field of Murderous Intent with radius 1m.</p>
<p>Field of Murderous Intent: When using a weapon, roll 1d6+2 instead of 1d6. If
your result is more than 6, treat it as 6. Lasts until the end of the current
encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Flux Field</strong>, Tales: 2</p>
<p>One of the eight elements clings to you. Perhaps one of your distant ancestors
was touched by a dragon or powerful elemental. Perhaps your personality is self
similar to this element, or else you were placed under some magical curse, or
blessing.</p>
<p>Choose an element. Instead of creating an Empowered Field, you create an
Elemental Flux Field with radius 2m of that element.</p>
<p>Elemental Flux Field: When rolling an attack gain 1 Chaos, gain 2 Chaos on a
roll of 6. This chaos is always of the element of the Elemental Flux Field. The
Chaos appears on Magical, Physical, and Spiritual rolls.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="racial-traits"><a class="header" href="#racial-traits">Racial Traits</a></h1>
<p><strong>Topples Dice</strong>, Tales: 6, Requires: Goblin Racial</p>
<p>Luck shifts in odd ways around you. You may now spend two Goblin Points to shift
the side of a rolled dice to any adjacent (share a side length) face, rather
than re-rolling it.</p>
<p><strong>Sturdy as Scrap</strong>, Tales: 8, Requires: Drost Racial</p>
<p>Your wounds react stronger than your kin. Replace your racial ability with the
following: When wounded, gain +2 defense against all damage types of the same
category (Dexterous, Cognitive, or Resolve), until the end of the current
Encounter.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Reflexes</strong>, Tales: 6, Requires: Fairy Racial</p>
<p>Some call you jumpy. Unnervingly so. Replace your racial ability with the
following: At the start of Turn Time you may add -VIG*2 to your Initiative
roll.</p>
<p><strong>Pained Rage</strong>, Tales: 6, Requires: Goran Racial</p>
<p>The battle rage of your ancestors runs strong in you. Replace you racial ability
with the following: When you suffer a wound, do not regain Toughness. Instead
immediately take an extra turn. Gain Circumstance equal to your Tenacity*2 until
the end of your turn. If you wound a target during this extra turn, regain
toughness equal to your Tenacity. Effects that happen at the start of your turn
happen immediately. If the wound would kill you, gain this extra turn in
addition to your last action before death.</p>
<p><strong>Gossip</strong>, Tales: 8, Requires: Vincal or CNT 3+</p>
<p>You know a bit of everything about everyone. You have a maximum of 3 Gossip
Points, and begin with 3 Gossip Points. While conversing with a target you may
expend 1 Gossip Point to alter their Disposition towards another target (not
yourself) by plus or minus one, for the next hour. Some targets may be willing
to give you information in exchange for Gossip Points. You regain one or more
Gossip Points anytime you learn a particularly juicy bit of information that is
not common knowledge.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="warfare-traits"><a class="header" href="#warfare-traits">Warfare Traits</a></h1>
<p><strong>Tactical Hit</strong>, Tales: 2</p>
<p>The first time in a round someone fails to hit you with a shredding attack you
instead take the hit, and get to shift their attack die by 1. Gain 1
fortification in a defense of your choosing.</p>
<p><strong>Bloody Lust</strong>, Tales: 4</p>
<p>Your rage brings you power. Whenever you take shred take an additional point,
but increase all violence by +1 until you rest.</p>
